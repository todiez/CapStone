# Capstone for Full Stack Developer with MERN at MIT xPro

## Project Description
This project is for learning and to demonstrate the skills I was able to aquire during my MIT xPro course. I used an Atlas Mongo Database, DAL, React, Express and node.js to realize this project.

## Installation
Just run npm init after you cloned the repo. Then start the application with node index.js and go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
Maybe the free Mongo Database will be down in the future, I think I won't maintain it for the long run.

## Technology Stack
React for the Front End
Express and Node.js for the server/Back End
Mongo DB with Atlas
